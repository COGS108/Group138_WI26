    "#### Our Response:\n",
    "\n",
    "We are trying to determine if we can find a relationship between a movie cast's stardom level and the movie's performance. Films packed with celebrities often can gain a lot of initial interest in trailers and marketing as there are people that show up at movie theaters just to see a specific celebrity on the screen. However, factors like negative online ratings and word of mouth reactions can tank a movie's performance a lot more than any celebrity can boost it, so it is hard to determine for any given movie how well it will perform. We will look for long term trends to discover if celebrity status is a good enough sign of movie success or not. We will define ways to measure stardom and measure movie success.\n",
    "\n",
    "In \"A Quantitative Study on the Effect of Cast Member Celebrity on Film Success,\" researchers used a regression model and analyzed the top 20 grossing films from 2015-2019, so a total of 100 movies total. They discovered that increased celebrity status correlated with both increased revenue and improved public perception. We question the conclusion of this article as taking the top 20 grossing films can mislead analysis as it doesn't account for cases where a movie \"flops\" but has celebrities. The author notes constraints such as using only the top 7 actors/actresses in their stardom metrics. Moreover, the study uses the actor/actress's current stardom level, which does not work in cases where the movie makes the actor/actress famous post-release. We can address these issues by accounting for a larger amount of the cast in stardom and measuring the actor/actress's popularity at the time of movie release. Additionally, 100 movies is likely not a large enough sample size and these movies were pulled up until 2019; Now a lot of marketing is done through social media which was not such a big tactic back then. Therefore, we can try to acquire data from a greater amount of movies and also use more recent movies.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, in \"The Power of Stars: Do Star Actors Drive the Success of Movies?\" the researchers examine whether hiring star actors measurably increases a film’s expected theatrical revenue, using prediction‑market data and stock‑market style reactions around casting announcements. The study finds that, on average, attaching a star adds a few million dollars to a movie’s expected box‑office, quantifying star power to 3‑million‑dollar increase in revenue rather than treating it as a vague marketing benefit. Elberse shows that this effect is not constant. The marginal impact of a new star is larger when the existing cast is already strong, meaning other members within groups are important rather than simple “one big name is enough” logic. By focusing on expected revenue before release, the paper frames stars as a costly but quantifiable investment whose value must be weighed against high salaries and profit participation. However, a \"star\" is defined as actors who already have HSX StarBonds, which requires at least two major roles. That excludes emerging talent and underestimates cases where a film itself creates a star which this paper ignores, a similar flaw to the one found in the first document.\n",
    "\n",
    "In determining how we determine \"prestige\" of a movie's cast, we came across \"Factors Affecting the Financial Success of Motion Pictures: What is the Role of Star Power?\" in which they coin the term \"star power\" for this metric. In this paper they describe using the number of nominations for Academy awards and average lifetime gross revenue of films involving the specific celebrity. Again, to avoid previously discussed issues, we wlil have to make sure we use these stats respective to the time in wihch the movie came out, not present day. This document also reveals some surprising findings like that the time of year of the movie's release didn't seem to matter, nor did the genre make a significant impact. We will still take these into account when analyzing these movies, as we can never be completely sure if there truly is no effect from these features. They end up acknowledging how subjective star power is given how everyone has their unique perception and is thus difficult to measure. This only reinforces the notion that we should find many different ways to measure stardom.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also found a similar project on Github, \"IMDb_ratings_analysis\" that goes more broad and tries to find multiple parameters for a movie's success, as well as predict if a movie is going to do well based on discovered factors. They even perform plot analysis as part of their analysis. We do not plan on going this far with our project, but these are good stretch goals to include. For now, we will just focus on the celebrity status of our movie casts.\n",

    "- \"A Quantitative Study on the Effect of Cast Member Celebrity on Film Success\" (2022): * Finding: Using a cross-sectional regression model, this study found that while a star-studded cast significantly boosts commercial success (box office), it has almost zero correlation with \"artistic merit\" (critical acclaim). https://www.researchgate.net/publication/369955734_The_Fault_in_Our_Stars_A_Quantitative_Study_on_the_Effect_of_Cast_Member_Celebrity_on_Film_Success\n",

Testing was done with regressions, interactions with existing cast strength, and robustness to alternative windows, star thresholds, and realized revenue validation. \n",

    "We hypothesize that the star cast won't actually correlate to how well the users rate it. Even with a good star cast, viewers can still find a movie not enjoyable to watch, and based on the background information, it seems like that is the case."

    "The ideal dataset we would want includes movie information such as title, duration, cast, and genre, as well as the IMDb rating of that movie. This data would be collected from the IMDb database, which is publicly available. We would probably store this dataset as a csv, with at least several thousands of movie entries to make a conclusive claim that the star cast affects the movie rating. Ideally we would have ratings from other sites like Rotten Tomatoes to offer another perspective along with looking at quantitative metrics like ticket sales and opening weekend box office numbers.\n",

The one issue is that it doesn't contain the IMDb rating of each movie, so we will have to web scrape the ratings.\n",

With this data set we'd be able to have direct access to the movies rank which can help determine how popular it was, as well as concrete numbers. Would be interesting to see the difference between international and domestic box office numbers to see if a household name in the US would cause a raise in box office numbers there but not necessarily internationally.\n",
